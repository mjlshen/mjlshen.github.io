=================

Here's my personal website courtesy of Github and Namecheap!

Currently I'm poking aroung and exploring. Mostly, I'm looking for stuff to borrow on Github so I get something that looks nice (suggestions here would be appreciated). After I'm somewhat satisfied I'll start modifying it to suit my needs. When all that is done I'll say goodbye to Blogger and host a blog on here.

Somewhere in the middle I want to convert integrate this with flask and perhaps MongoDB if I'm adventurous enough.
