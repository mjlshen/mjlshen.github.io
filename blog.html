							<h2>Evolution Matters</h2>
							<p>"The scientific theory of evolution" has a nice ring to it. It's a fairly innocent statement, but a lot of people get stuck on the keywords: "scientific," "theory," and "evolution." It seems to me that mostly Christians make a stand against evolution. (I am aware that not all share this belief.) I don't mean to needlessly attack Christianity, but it is what I am most familiar with, so it pains me when I see people strive to portray evolution as an attack on Christianity.</p>
							<p>As a scientific theory, evolution was by definition developed from scientific observation, using the scientific method. Evolution was not theorized to spite anyone, nor anything. It has been sufficiently confirmed to be considered a scientific theory...by science. It may be against prior thoughts, fly against the face of what we think is reasonable, but so far, it still stands. Evolution is not always obvious.</p>
							<p>It should seem far-fetched that the dinosaurs that are still alive essentially evolved into birds. It's fairly well accepted by the scientific community, but whether you accept that or not, you had better accept that the dinosaurs no longer exist as they once did. You will not find any kind of tyrannosaur, hadrosaur, nor ceratopsian; they're extinct. That's no theory, it's a fact. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth when no humans were alive, so we can't be sure why they died, but humans were alive when mammoths and emus still lived. We painted pictures of them, hunted them, touched them. As a species, they perished. This is the result of the often coined "survival of the fittest."</p>
							<p>The question most people face is with what I think of as "positive" evolution. Evolving to become better, as opposed to dying off. For example, a giraffe's neck getting longer, humans standing upright, some land mammal evolving into whales; there are a lot of bizarre results. Not all of them have complete fossil evidence. That's because fossilization is incredibly rare. It's much more likely that the remains of an organism will rot and decompose instead of fossilizing, but some of them still manage to do so! Check out the <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/images/shermer_whale.gif">whale's fossil record</a>. As humans, we were unable to document that kind of change, as we did not exist yet, but evolution doesn't stop.</p>
							<p>An ongoing experiment with E. coli is attempting to demonstrate evolution. The details are there if you're curious, but in short, the E. coli is, indeed evolving. Still, it's a microorganism, most people have never seen it. What about dog breeds? They have been mixed and matched to suit the owners wishes for so long that they are very different from what they once were in the past. There are more examples, but it is cases like these that lead scientists to call evolution a theory.</p>
							<p>It is often brought up that gravity is indeed, still a theory to convince others. Personally, I think that's an unfair comparison. It is comparing biology to physics, which are related, but maybe not sufficiently enough for everyone. How about a more relevant one: germ theory. That's the theory that some diseases are caused by germs. Sound like obvious knowledge to you too? Now, it is important to keep in mind that theories are theories because there is still some level of uncertainty. They may still be incomplete or require modifications. However, it is very unlikely that a theory is completely false.</p>
							<p>If you're still skeptical, <i>that's fine</i>. Skepticism drives science. That's how evolution and any other scientific theory came to be, but I ask that you be an informed skeptic. In spite of all that evolution has going for it, there's a reason it's still a theory. I hope that even those who wholeheartedly deny evolutionary theory understand how it logically came to be. Evolution may be proven wrong, but it's not irrational.</p>
							<p><i>If there are any more questions, I'll be happy to add them and my answers below this message.</i></p>
							<p><b><i>Q:</i></b> I agree that microevolution (small changes to a species) occurs, but what about macroevolution (big changes, resulting in new species)?</p>
							<p><b><i>A:</i></b> I'm under the impression that macroevolution is the manifestation of microevolution over a longer time frame. Whales are evidence of macroevolution, this can be traced through their fossil record. They aren't alone though, there are many examples. Horses are also evidence of macroevolution, which can be seen through their own fossil record. There are more recent examples though, most notably in the Galápagos Islands. The finches there vary from island to island and also from the mainland because some islands favored a specific lifestyle, which in turn favored different body sizes, beak sizes, beak shapes, and so on. These small changes, microevolution, if you will, happened as a result of natural selection, but now they are considered different species.</p>
