I recently found a recalled a fun/profound probability-related problem and suggested it to a former high school teacher. We struck up a short conversation and she sent me off with a lack of surprise that I was doing well. Of course, this was meant as a compliment and I place no blame on her, but for myself it struck a deeper chord. One that still affects me greatly but one that comes up so frequently I've made a habit of passing off as nothing. Simply put, it's no passing circumstance that I am where I am today. Just one year ago, my mental state was deeply in question, both by professionals and by myself. In the end, there was no determined cause, but I'm writing now because I think I finally understand.

All the way through 12th grade, I've been a habitual show-off. I made the smallest things into competitions and I had to win as many as I could.
